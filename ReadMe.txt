This is the SHUHealthMonitoring application, some functionality has had an attempt at being implemented, but ultimately didn't work due to .net7 bugs and errors. 
Some of these bugs were unfixable after many hours of research, so i present to you what i have completed. I have completed this with little to no knowledge of blazor.
I have tried my damnest to complete this, and i feel ok with my end result, it is not what i would have liked ideally, but it shows my current ability with blazor C#.
Much of the system is there in code but my not work in actuality.
